Because we have a 2D square lattice, the square root of the number suggests how many neurons we can have for each dimension.

In the case of a neuron where no BMU is selected, we assigned the class value 2 as unidentifiable. Figures 3–7–1 and 3–7–2 show the created label map for the 1st and the final iteration. In the beginning, many of the neurons are neither 0 nor 1 and the class labels appear to be scattered randomly; the final iteration clearly shows the region separation between the class 0 and 1 though we see a couple of cells that do not belong to either class at the final iteration."
